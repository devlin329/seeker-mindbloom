# Privacy Policy for MindBloom

Last Updated: 2026-01-29

MindBloom is committed to protecting user privacy. This policy explains our stance on data collection and how we handle information in connection with the application.

## 1. Data Collection & Wallet Interaction

- **Personal Information**: MindBloom does not collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, or device IDs.
- **Crypto Wallet**: We integrate with third-party wallet applications (e.g., Phantom and other Solana Mobile Wallet Adapter–compliant wallets) to allow users to connect their Solana wallets.
- **Public Address**: We collect and process your public wallet address solely for authentication and to enable game features (such as submitting scores and viewing the leaderboard).
- **Private Keys**: We **never** access, collect, or store your private keys or seed phrases. All transaction signatures are performed securely within your external wallet application.
- **On-Chain Data**: Certain interactions (such as score submissions) may be recorded publicly on the Solana blockchain via the SPL Memo program.

## 2. Permissions

The app only requires standard permissions necessary for game execution and network access for wallet connectivity. It does not request access to your contacts, camera, microphone, or location.

## 3. Data Storage & Game Stats

- **Local Storage**: All game progress, including best times and statistics, is stored locally on your device.
- **No Cloud Sync**: This data is not automatically uploaded to any external servers or cloud storage services owned by us.

## 4. Third-Party Services & Links

- **External Links**: This app may contain links to third-party websites (e.g., social media or Solana ecosystem sites). We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of those external sites.
- **No Tracking**: This app does not integrate any third-party analytics or advertising platforms that track user behavior.

## 5. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the revised policy and update the "Last Updated" date. Your continued use of the app after changes indicates your acceptance of the updated policy.
